# Scene Management

## Overview

The Scene Management System is responsible for loading, unloading, and transitioning between different scenes in the game, such as levels, menus, or cutscenes.

## Key Concepts

### Scene Graph

Scenes can be organized using a scene graph, which represents the hierarchical structure of entities in the scene.

### Loading and Unloading

Use `scene_manager_load_scene()` to load a new scene and `scene_manager_unload_scene()` to clean up.

## Workflow

### Loading a Scene

Call `scene_manager_load_scene("level")` to load a new scene named "level".

### Transitioning

Implement scene transitions (e.g., fading in/out) to provide smooth changes between scenes.

## Extending Scene Management

Add functionality for saving/loading game state, or implement asynchronous scene loading to improve performance for large scenes.
