# Memory Management

## Overview

The Memory Management System is crucial for ensuring the game engine runs efficiently, without memory leaks or fragmentation. The system provides custom allocators, including memory pools and stack-based allocation.

## Key Concepts

### Memory Pools

Memory pools are used for efficiently managing entities and components that are frequently created and destroyed. Pools reduce the overhead of dynamic memory allocation.

### Stack-Based Allocation

This type of allocation is useful for temporary data that can be freed in bulk, providing better performance for certain tasks.

## Using Memory Pools

### Creating a Pool

Use `memory_pool_create()` to create a memory pool.

### Allocating from a Pool

Allocate memory for a new component from the pool.

### Freeing Memory

Use `memory_pool_free()` to free memory back to the pool.

## Extending Memory Management

Implement additional allocators, such as double-ended allocators or garbage collection for specific resources, to improve memory efficiency.
